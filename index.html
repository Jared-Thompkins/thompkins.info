                I am very grateful to be pursuing my Second Bachelor's and passion for computer science at Western Governors University. One of the things I love about WGU is the strong online community of fellow students who share my enthusiasm for the field. As WGU hackers, we constantly push

                  enrolled students as possible. UIUC is home to a diverse range of on-campus clubs and activities. I was a member of the  National Association of Black Accountants (NABA) and also participated in intramural basketball, flag football, and even tried my hand at underwater hockey. During my senior year, I was fortunate to serve as a Resident Advisor (RA). This role helped me learn a lot about myself and my own subconscious biases, as well as how to build community, lead events, and teach. I was also on call at times, gaining valuable experience in managing emergencies and addressing student needs. In addition to my extracurricular activities, I also formed strong connections with fellow students and professors in the classroom. Despite the pandemic, I chose to have as many of my classes as possible in-person, which allowed me to delve deeply into the class material.
