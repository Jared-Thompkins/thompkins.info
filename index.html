                <p>I am very grateful to be pursuing <b>Second Bachelor's</b> and passion for computer science at <b>Western Governors University</b>. One of the things I love about WGU is the strong online community of fellow students who share my enthusiasm for the field. As WGU hackers, we constantly push ourselves to grow and learn, and together we form a strong community. Additionally, I appreciate the flexibility that the <b>self-paced</b> program provides, allowing me to work at my own pace. With the ability to control my own schedule and progress, I can take the time to thoroughly understand the course material and work through difficult concepts. <br><br>

                  I am excited about the prospects of joining the impressive network of WGU alumni, who have a reputation for being accomplished and successful in their chosen fields. I'm confident that the skills and knowledge I'm gaining at WGU will help me to achieve my own goals and make meaningful contributions to the field of computer science.

                <p>My journey at UIUC began as a transfer student in the midst of the pandemic (August 2020). At move-in, I shared a living space with 3 individuals whom I hadn't met before but who eventually became my lifelong friends. During my time at the university, I aimed to connect with as many of the 40,000 enrolled students as possible. <br><br>

                  UIUC is home to a diverse range of on-campus clubs and activities. I was a member of the <b> National Association of Black Accountants (NABA)</b> and also participated in intramural basketball, flag football, and even tried my hand at underwater hockey. During my senior year, I was fortunate to serve as a <b>Resident Advisor (RA) </b>. This role helped me learn a lot about myself and my own subconscious biases, as well as how to build community, lead events, and teach. I was also on call at times, gaining valuable experience in managing emergencies and addressing student needs. <br><br>
                  
                  In addition to my extracurricular activities, I also formed strong connections with fellow students and professors in the classroom. Despite the pandemic, I chose to have as many of my classes as possible in-person, which allowed me to delve deeply into the class material.
